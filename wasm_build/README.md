# MarketMaker2 wasm example

**wasm_build** is an example of using **MarketMaker2** in webpages via [WebAssembly](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly)

## How to build

The below steps are performed in the `atomicDEX-API/` root directory.

### Compile MarketMaker2 to wasm

```
wasm-pack build --target web --out-dir wasm_build/deps/pkg/
```

Note the command above compiles and optimizes the wasm binary. If you want to disable optimizations to reduce the compilation time, run the following:
```
wasm-pack build --dev --target web --out-dir wasm_build/deps/pkg/
```
