# Support for split-debuginfo [should eventually](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/34651) land,
# hopefully giving us an out-of-the-box way to separate the code from the debugging information.
# We should use the "objcopy --only-keep-debug" and "add-symbol-file" meanwhile
# and separating stack tracing into raw trace and symbolication parts.
